      "content": "It was pickup time at the day care. As other children and parents milled about, Tanya Leshchenko sat on a bench in a hallway and bundled her 5-year-old daughter into a purple winter coat. But before stepping outside, one more task remained. Ms. Leshchenko checked an online chat group for warnings of incoming attack drones. The group posts crowdsourced alerts in the city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, where the daily risk of death from flying robots offers a vision of an eerie, postapocalyptic future. One warning last fall simply said, \"I hear a drone!\" - an ominous buzzing that has become a grim, intermittent soundtrack in the city. On the day when Ms. Leshchenko, 36, was picking up her daughter, however, the sky was calm. They walked out and headed toward the bus stop. \"You cannot outrun a drone,\" Ms. Leshchenko said, before adding: \"It's scary.\" In Kherson, a city of broad tree-lined boulevards and stately czarist-era mansions, residents fear the open sky. The entire city lies within range of cheap Russian quadcopter drones, which Moscow's forces launch from territory they occupy just across the Dnipro River. Much of the population of Kherson has fled. Those that are left in the city say they have a fear of the open sky. A worker removing leaves from anti-drone netting over a thoroughfare. The city is experimenting with myriad drone defenses, including dozens of miles of nets intended to catch drones before they reach an object and explode. About 200 civilians have been killed and 2,000 wounded in drone strikes over the past year, the authorities say. Ukrainians call the attacks a \"human safari.\" Russian drone operators drop grenades on people working in their gardens or ambling down sidewalks. Kherson, whose population has fallen to about 65,000 after three-quarters of residents fled, has become the site of the most intensive use of drones in targeting civilians anywhere in the world, rights groups say. The United Nations has called the attacks war crimes . Life is moving below ground. Hospitals, a maternity ward, government offices, a theater and dozens of other institutions have been relocated to underground sites. Basement activity rooms have replaced outdoor playgrounds. All schools are online only. The city is experimenting with myriad drone defenses, though none are wholly effective. The military has built a wall of jamming antennas along a riverbank. Dozens of miles of nets intended to catch drones before they reach an object and explode have been strung over thoroughfares. On sidewalks, 250 concrete escape chambers have been set up. Municipal workers carry hand-held drone detectors as they labor outside repairing bomb damage or mending drone nets. The devices work by intercepting feeds from drones' cameras, showing what the Russian drone operator sees when zeroing in on a target. Seeing yourself or your car on the detector's screen is terrible news. \"You need to reach maximum speed and maneuver\" to get out of sight, Yaroslav Shanko, Kherson's military-civilian administrator, said of evading a drone once detected. Municipal workers carry hand-held drone detectors as they labor outside repairing bomb damage. It happened once to Yaroslav Shanko, the city's military-civilian administrator, a position akin to mayor. How did he respond? \"You need to reach maximum speed and maneuver\" to get out of the drone's view, Mr. Shanko said. Screeching around corners and plowing down alleys at more than 80 miles per hour, Mr. Shanko's driver escaped the drone. Rights groups say that other war-torn or crime-afflicted cities around the world are likely to look like Kherson in the future. Small quadcopter drones, some adapted from hobbyist models, have democratized precision-guided munitions that previously cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. They have been used to target civilians in the Sudanese civil war and in Mexican gang conflicts , said Belkis Wille, an associate director at Human Rights Watch. \"Kherson is the clearest example of a campaign to target civilians with quadcopter drones, but this is really just the start of what we fear will become a reality for civilians in conflict areas\" across the globe, Ms. Wille said. \"The cost of targeting civilians has come way down.\" Kherson has never caught a break through four years of war. Russian forces occupied the city for nine months at the start of the full-scale invasion, before retreating. An 18th-century Russian aristocrat and lover of Catherine the Great, Prince Grigory Potemkin, is considered the founder of the modern city and was buried in a local church. When they retreated, Russian soldiers took his bones with them . After Ukrainian troops liberated Kherson in November 2022, Russian forces took to firing artillery into the city from across the river. Once small drones evolved into effective weapons the following year, a new scourge began. Volodymyr Oleinichuk, a parking lot attendant, in the foreground, dived under a shed after hearing a drone. It dropped a grenade, and he was wounded by shrapnel. Volodymyr Baiadarov, 53, lost a leg after stepping on a butterfly mine that had been dropped by a drone. Drone injuries are now so common, said Oleh Pinchuk, a surgeon, that, \"We forgot about car accidents here.\" Sometimes, the wounded watch wide-eyed in a hospital bed, several days into their recovery, when Russian forces post online from the camera of the drone that attacked them. They see themselves on the screen, getting bigger and bigger as the drone draws nearer. Once drones close in, they are all but impossible to evade . Mykola Hyadamaka, 67, a retired driver, recalled hearing a drone chasing his car. He raced home and tried to dash in his front door but fumbled with the gate to his yard. He was hit by shrapnel from a grenade. \"There is no escape,\" he said in an interview in his hospital bed. Serhiy Schevchenko, 36, a plumber, was chased by a drone around a tree before it blew up nearby. \"There was nowhere to hide,\" he said. Volodymyr Oleinichuk, 52, a parking lot attendant, dived under a shed after hearing a drone. It circled overhead, waiting for him to crawl out, he said. When he did not, it dropped a grenade near the foundation, spraying shrapnel under the shed and wounding him. A particularly frightening aspect of drone attacks, Mr. Oleinichuk noted, is the sense of intelligence driving the machine as a pilot searches and maneuvers. \"There is somebody behind it, controlling it,\" Mr. Oleinichuk said. \"I heard how he was looking for me.\" A dance class at an underground school. Basement activity rooms have replaced outdoor playgrounds. Students during a games and recreation class in an underground school. With schools closed, underground activity areas are among the few places for children to socialize. They offer dance, art and other classes, and screen movies. A dance class at one center was called \"United by Love.\" Organizers put sandboxes in the subterranean play areas on the theory that children needed a substitute for touching soil in playgrounds. Outside, danger lurks. When drones come, \"You need to hide in a shelter, or just anywhere where you cannot see the sky,\" said Daria, an 11-year-old who over the summer hid under trees in a park when a drone flew over. Although so many have fled Kherson, Ms. Leshchenko, the woman who picked up her daughter, Alyona, at day care recently, said that she did not plan to leave. Her family has nowhere to go, she added. Once she got to the bus stop, a concrete shelter would provide protection. She would check the online chat group again. Then she would walk home quickly, holding Alyona's hand.

      "title": "Trump Says Putin Agreed to a Weeklong Pause in Attacks Amid Extreme Cold",
      "content": "President Trump said on Thursday that the Kremlin had agreed to a temporary pause in its missile attacks on Kyiv amid the fierce cold in the Ukrainian capital, a shift that, if true, would represent the latest sign that Ukraine-Russia peace talks are gaining momentum. The Kremlin confirmed the pause on Friday morning, saying that Mr. Trump had made the request to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for a weeklong pause on strikes on Kyiv that would last until Feb. 1. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to answer questions about what exactly would be off limits as a result of the pause, but said the goal was the \"creation of favorable conditions for holding talks.\" President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, speaking a few hours after Mr. Trump, thanked the United States for its efforts to halt Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure but stopped short of declaring that there would be a reprieve. \"We hope the United States can make this happen,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"The situation tonight and over these days - the real situation at our energy facilities and in our cities - will show how things stand.\" An adviser to the Ukrainian president's office said that Ukraine had asked for a pause in strikes in a meeting with Russian negotiators last weekend, and that the Russian side had agreed, but not in writing. In Russia, reports of an order to hold fire temporarily on Kyiv and Ukrainian energy targets surfaced early Thursday on the Telegram accounts of pro-war bloggers close to the Russian military. Russia pounded cities across Ukraine with drone and missile strikes earlier this week, but there were no major airstrikes on Ukrainian cities on Thursday. Russia has left thousands of apartment buildings in Kyiv without heat during the extreme cold of recent weeks, in a campaign against Ukrainian energy infrastructure that has appeared aimed at breaking the country's morale. \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week,\" Mr. Trump said at a televised cabinet meeting at the White House on Thursday. \"And he agreed to do that.\" It was not clear when or how Mr. Trump made that request, and neither the White House nor the Kremlin have disclosed a phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin since December. But Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators met in the United Arab Emirates last weekend in the first such trilateral talks since Russia's invasion in 2022. The Ukrainians and Russians are expected to meet again in the coming days, possibly with a U.S. presence, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday. \"I think the people of Ukraine are now hopeful and expectant that we're going to deliver a peace deal sometime soon,\" Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's peace envoy who participated in last weekend's talks, said at Thursday's cabinet meeting. Mr. Trump and Mr. Witkoff have spoken about progress toward ending Russia's invasion repeatedly over the last year, only to see the fierce fighting continue. Both sides agreed to a 30-day cease-fire on energy infrastructure targets last spring, but the move failed to pave the way for a broader deal. This time, however, Russian and Ukrainian officials are speaking directly with each other, in a departure from the Trump administration's efforts at shuttle diplomacy last year. The partial cease-fire described by Mr. Trump could emerge as a key test of the new approach. The adviser to the Ukrainian president's office, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, referred to the pause as a \"gentlemen's agreement\" among negotiators. The agreement did not stick immediately. After Russia launched drones and missiles at Odesa and at a passenger train on Tuesday , killing five people on the train, the Russian negotiators privately apologized, the Ukrainian adviser said, and explained that not all branches of the Russian military had been told to hold fire. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, declined to comment on the matter on Thursday, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Samuel Charap, a Russia and Ukraine expert at RAND Corporation, a security research organization in Washington, said that the temporary halt could represent \"a confidence-building measure\" to \"demonstrate seriousness of purpose in a negotiation.\" \"It's not an indication that the strikes will end for good,\" Mr. Charap said. Ukraine sent senior officials, including Mr. Zelensky's chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov, to last weekend's talks in Abu Dhabi. Russia sent the powerful head of its military intelligence agency, Igor Kostyukov; Mr. Witkoff said that \"five Russian generals\" participated in total. The stature of the interlocutors is one signal that the negotiations may be gaining traction, even as it remained far from clear whether the talks could succeed in ending the fighting. Negotiators have had to contend with a wide range of issues, including Mr. Putin's determination to keep Ukraine from joining the NATO alliance and Mr. Zelensky's desire for security guarantees from the West to help deter a future Russian invasion. On Wednesday, Mr. Rubio said during a Senate hearing that the \"one remaining item\" at issue in the talks was Russia's demand for control of all of the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, including the part now controlled by Kyiv. \"It's still a bridge we haven't crossed,\" Mr. Rubio said. \"It's still a gap, but at least we've been able to narrow down the issue set to one central one, and it will probably be a very difficult one.\" Asked about that comment on Thursday, the Kremlin foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, said in an interview with the Russian state Channel One that while the territory issue was the \"main question,\" others were still unresolved. He said that Russia had not given its assent to the security guarantees Western nations had pledged to offer Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, raised questions about those guarantees in comments on Thursday, criticizing any arrangement that he said would allow the current government in Ukraine to continue threatening Russia. \"We don't know what guarantees were agreed, but apparently, those are guarantees for the Ukrainian regime which has pursued the Russophobic, neo-Nazi policy course,\" Mr. Lavrov said. Mr. Zelensky had previously described the negotiation over security guarantees as \"100 percent done,\" and he said Kyiv was waiting to sign an agreement with its partners. Mr. Rubio, during his testimony to the Senate, said the security arrangements agreed upon \"involve the deployment of a handful of European troops, primarily French and the U.K., and then a U.S. backstop.\" \"There's a lot of talk about security guarantees, and it's something that there's general agreement about now with the case of Ukraine,\" Mr. Rubio said.

      "title": "Federal Judge Temporarily Blocks End of Protection for Haitians in U.S.",
      "content": "A federal judge late on Monday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending a humanitarian protection for more than 350,000 Haitians, who have been able to live and work in the United States under what is known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S. Judge Ana C. Reyes of the Federal District Court in Washington denied the administration's motion to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the Department of Homeland Security's termination of T.P.S., set for Feb. 3. The plaintiffs' request for the status to remain in place was granted until the case is fully litigated. In a scathing, 83-page ruling, Judge Reyes said that the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, did not have the authority to end the status and that her arguments that maintaining T.P.S. for Haitians was not in the national interest were flawed. Her reasoning, the judge wrote, \"focuses on Haitians outside the United States or here illegally, ignoring that Haitian T.P.S. holders already live here, and legally so.\" That analysis must also include economic considerations, according to the law. But Ms. Noem, Judge Reyes wrote, \"ignores altogether the billions Haitian T.P.S. holders contribute to the economy.\" The ruling offers a reprieve for Haitians with T.P.S., some of whom have lived in the country for years. But the federal government is almost certain to appeal, leaving the Haitians in limbo for the foreseeable future. Ultimately, their fate could end up decided by the Supreme Court. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement that the administration would be heading to the high court. \"Temporary means temporary,\" she said, \"and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench.\" Judge Reyes said the administration was motivated, at least in part, by racial animus against Haiti, which is a majority Black country, and that its termination ran afoul of the law. Read the Decision Read Document 83 pages \"The mismatch between what the secretary said in the termination and what the evidence shows confirms that the termination of Haiti's T.P.S. designation was not the product of reasoned decision-making, but of a preordained outcome justified by pretextual reasons,\" she wrote. Created by Congress, Temporary Protected Status is a designation that the U.S. government can give to countries grappling with natural disasters, armed conflicts or other acute crises that make conditions in the country particularly dangerous. Under T.P.S., people from those countries who are already in the United States can remain temporarily. When a country loses the T.P.S. designation, former recipients fall out of legal status and can be deported. Haiti first received the designation in 2010 after a devastating earthquake. It has been extended several times since, most recently by the Biden administration in 2021, after the assassination of the country's last elected president. Since then, Haiti has been grappling with gang violence, political instability and food shortages. In the case before Judge Reyes, government lawyers asserted that repeated T.P.S. extensions by previous administrations effectively turned a temporary protection into permanent residency, which it argued was contrary to Congress's intent. In a separate T.P.S. case, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled on Jan. 29 that the homeland security secretary had exceeded the authority granted by Congress when she revoked the protection for Venezuelans. But that ruling had no immediate effect because the Supreme Court had already stayed a lower-court ruling in the case. T.P.S. recipients do not have a path to a green card or citizenship. But they remain in lawful status, with Social Security numbers and employment authorization, as long as the U.S. government extends the protection, typically every 18 months. In her decision on Monday, Judge Reyes, who was named to the federal bench by President Biden, said that the Trump administration had not conducted a required assessment to determine whether it was safe to return people to Haiti. She noted that senior government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, had said publicly that Haiti was facing \"immediate security challenges.\" The State Department currently assigns its highest warning against travel to Haiti, indicating that the U.S. government believes that visiting the country poses life-threatening risks. Ms. Noem's \"conclusion that Haiti (a majority nonwhite country) faces merely 'concerning' conditions cannot be squared with the 'perfect storm of suffering' and 'staggering humanitarian toll' described in page after page\" of the record, the judge wrote. The legal team that represented the Haitians applauded the ruling but said the legal fight was not over. \"Although the government will probably appeal, today's ruling allows Haitian T.P.S. holders to breathe a sigh of relief, even if only a small one,\" said Geoff Pipoly, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. \"We look forward to defending the court's ruling on appeal.\" The judge's decision was anxiously anticipated in Haitian communities, not least in Springfield, Ohio, the small city that was thrust into the national immigration debate after President Trump echoed baseless rumors during his campaign in late 2024 that Haitians there had been eating their neighbors' pets. Mayor Rob Rue, who has been navigating the fallout in the city that is home to more than 10,000 Haitians, said the judge's ruling was welcome news. \"This provides clarity and stability for families who are already part of our community, he said, adding that the decision reflected \"the reality that many individuals are working, paying taxes, raising families and contributing everyday to the life of our city.\" In her decision, the judge said that President Trump had disparaged many immigrants from the developing world, including Haiti, and she specifically made a reference to Springfield. At a minimum, she said, Mr. Trump had influenced Secretary Noem's decision through his many public statements. Since last year, the Trump administration has moved to terminate T.P.S. for about a million people from at least nine countries. As federal agents descended on Minnesota, the administration announced that it would end T.P.S. for Somalis. The health care, manufacturing and service sectors could lose hundreds of thousands of workers if the status is terminated. Several courts have rejected the administration's efforts to end the program. On Dec. 31, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully terminated T.P.S. for more than 60,000 people from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua. In a separate ruling, on Dec. 30, a federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the termination of the status for about 230 people from South Sudan , similarly finding that the administration had acted unlawfully. The Homeland Security Department has said it strongly disagrees with the decisions in California and Boston, and has signaled its intent to appeal.",

      "title": "Banfield Found Guilty in Virginia Double Murder Trial",
      "content": "Brendan Banfield was found guilty on Monday of killing his wife and another man, the culmination of a case whose lurid details - a fetish website, an extramarital affair and an elaborate scheme - captured international attention. The trial over the murders of Christine Banfield, who was fatally stabbed, and Joseph Ryan, who was shot to death, included testimonies from Mr. Banfield, and his Brazilian au pair, Juliana Peres Magalhães. Prosecutors had accused Ms. Magalhães, who was also Mr. Banfield's lover, of helping Mr. Banfield plan and carry out the killings so that the two could be together. Ms. Magalhães had earlier pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for testifying against Mr. Banfield. Mr. Banfield could face life in prison. Sentencing is tentatively scheduled for May 8. Inside the courthouse, Mr. Banfield's reaction to the verdict was muted. His parents looked somber, and Ms. Banfield's parents wept. There were no family members of Mr. Ryan in attendance on Monday, according to the prosecutors. Prosecutors said that Mr. Banfield, 40, plotted to lure Mr. Ryan to the family's home by posing, with Ms. Magalhães's assistance, as Ms. Banfield on a fetish website. Mr. Ryan, 38, was led to think he was being invited to enact a violent sexual role-play scenario that Ms. Banfield, 37, had proposed. Prosecutors accused Mr. Banfield and Ms. Magalhães, 25, of arranging for Mr. Ryan to visit the home while Ms. Banfield was alone. After Mr. Ryan entered the bedroom where Ms. Banfield was, prosecutors said, Mr. Banfield followed him, shot him with his pistol and then stabbed his wife, staging the scene to appear as if he had come to his wife's aid. Ms. Magalhães, who was also accused of shooting Mr. Ryan, said that she indeed had opened fire after seeing him move. In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Banfield, a former agent for the criminal division of the Internal Revenue Service, called the accusations \"absolutely crazy.\" He said that his wife had engaged in affairs of her own and that it was actually Mr. Ryan who had fatally stabbed Ms. Banfield despite his attempts to save her. The verdict, which found Mr. Banfield guilty on two counts of aggravated murder, one count of using a firearm in commission of a felony and one count of child endangerment, ends a yearslong case that spawned true crime podcasts and captivated online commenters in the United States and Brazil. The killings occurred on Feb. 24, 2023. That morning, police officers responded to 911 calls placed by Ms. Magalhães. At the Banfields' home in Herndon, Va., a large house on a cul-de-sac in suburban Washington, they found Ms. Banfield, a pediatric nurse, who had been stabbed in the upper body, and Mr. Ryan, who had been shot dead. Ms. Banfield died of her injuries soon after. Mr. Banfield, Ms. Magalhães and the Banfields' 4-year-old daughter were also at the home, unharmed. The daughter was in the basement when the killings occurred. Ms. Magalhães was initially charged with second-degree murder in October 2023 before reaching a plea agreement a year later. Prosecutors have said they would recommend that she is sentenced to time served. A key question in the case was whether jurors should trust Ms. Magalhães. In her testimony, she said that Mr. Banfield's plan to kill Ms. Banfield and Mr. Ryan had involved weeks of preparation, and that she had helped him run the fake account on the fetish website. Mr. Banfield's lawyer, John Carroll, said that Ms. Magalhães had also entered negotiations with a journalist who was interested in buying her story. Their tentative plan, according to messages shared in court, was to make a documentary for Netflix. Ms. Magalhães said she had agreed to testify against Mr. Banfield because it was \"the right thing to do,\" but Mr. Carroll questioned her credibility and told jurors to consider the circumstances surrounding her agreement with the prosecutors. \"When they lie and manipulate to get someone to make a statement, that's not discovering the truth,\" Mr. Carroll said during his closing statement on Friday. \"That's planting the truth.\" He added that physical and digital evidence - including blood stains on the clothes of Mr. Banfield and Mr. Ryan on the morning of the killing, and phone records that gave clues as to who had been running the account on the fetish website - suggested that Mr. Banfield was not guilty. \"Obviously, I believe we had the evidence in our favor,\" Mr. Carroll said on Monday after the verdict was read. He added that he did not yet know whether Mr. Banfield would appeal. The lawyer for the prosecution, Jenna Sands, said that the evidence - even aside from Ms. Magalhães's testimony - had pointed to Mr. Banfield's guilt. After the trial, she said that she had been surprised to see Mr. Banfield testify in his own defense. \"I think that he was obviously hoping for a life with Juliana,\" Ms. Sands added, \"and he didn't see a way to accomplish that without executing his wife.\"",

Ordinarily, they would need to be weighed to determine any change, but in this case the results were unmistakable to the naked eye: The prostates treated with the researchers' new drug had shrunk considerably, unlike those in the rats treated with testosterone. Everyone on Dalton's research team gathered to gaze triumphantly. The potential medical uses of this new drug were profound: building muscle mass in cancer patients with muscle-wasting conditions; improving strength in patients with osteoporosis; combating frailty in the elderly; treating incontinence in women with weak pelvic muscles. \"I knew we were onto something,\" Dalton said with a widening smile. Their study was published three years later. But something strange happened on the way to bringing the revolutionary medicine to market. Dalton got a call from the United States Anti-Doping Agency. There was a big problem. His drug was not approved for humans, but it was somehow turning up in Olympic-level athletes. Dalton's laboratory creation, which would become known as ostarine, was causing havoc in the sports world. Decades later, it still is. It might have even prevented one American athlete from making the Olympic team for this month's Winter Games in Italy. In 2000, Dalton was a pioneering researcher in an emerging class of drugs known as SARMs, or selective androgen receptor modulators. His research was aimed at treating significant medical problems. Testosterone and anabolic steroids, he explained, can provide meaningful health benefits - notably muscle growth - but come with side effects. For example, a woman being treated with testosterone could experience masculinizing issues like hair growth and a deepening voice. Dalton's discovery offered patients the benefits without those unwanted effects. The publication of Dalton's team's research in The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics was like publishing a recipe on Epicurious. Patent be damned, pharmaceutical chefs around the world got to work cooking up the new drug. They knew there would be buyers. Distributors in the United States, with names like Warrior Labz and Accelerated Genetix , purchased ostarine from abroad - manufacturers in China were especially productive - and sold it from sleek websites that boasted of tiptop quality control and \"third-party testing for purity.\" The distributors were often traced to residential addresses, or mailboxes at UPS stores in strip malls. \"We arrested a lot of these guys,\" said Dan Burke, who was chief of cyber investigations for the Food and Drug Administration before joining the antidoping agency as its intelligence and investigations director. \"These dudes have no idea what they're handling.\" Dalton began hearing from recreational athletes asking for guidance. The clinical trials with humans generally involved doses of 3-9 milligrams per day. Some weekend warriors were experimenting with 50-70 milligrams a day - or more. Dalton knew from his research that doses of 25 milligrams and higher on a daily basis could have unwelcome effects on males. \"It's signaling in their brain, 'OK, I've got enough testosterone,' so that they stop producing testosterone,\" he said. \"Their testes shrink and they become infertile.\" The drug spread rampantly across the sports landscape. Soon, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency was calling Dalton for information, and the World Anti-Doping Agency added ostarine to its list of banned substances. Weight lifters, runners, snowboarders, mixed martial arts fighters and motorcycle racers all tested positive. So did a cyclist, a pentathlete, a jiu-jitsu competitor and a hockey player. \"It seemed to come out of nowhere,\" said Matt Fedoruk, the chief science officer for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. And suddenly it was everywhere. The 2016 Olympic gold medalist in the pole vault tested positive for ostarine and was barred from the 2024 Paris Games. A U.S. Olympic gold medalist sprinter was sanctioned for testing positive for ostarine - twice. A British sprinter tested positive at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, resulting in his relay team being stripped of its silver medals. There were horses, too. A trainer in New Mexico was given a 34-year suspension and a trainer in Canada was suspended for 20 years for giving their horses ostarine. U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized thousands of pills at 11 ports of entry throughout the country over the past three years alone, according to a spokesman. Antidoping officials announced another sanction for ostarine on Jan. 23 - for a wheelchair rugby athlete. In March 2024, Sydney Milani, an American bobsledder, returned to the United States after the World Cup tour in Europe and was preparing for a competition in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was on her way to the training room when she received an email from antidoping officials. \"I didn't think it was for me,\" she said. \"Then I opened it and it had my name on it, and that's when the panic set in.\" Ostarine was suddenly popular because it worked well as a performance-enhancing drug. Athletes who used it generally got stronger. \"Every clinical trial we did, if you take 3 milliliters once a day for 12 weeks, you'll put on 3 pounds of lean muscle mass,\" Dalton said. The drug's chemical properties also might have had a lot to do with the rash of positive doping tests. Ostarine is described by chemists as a sticky substance, making it prone to latch on to other supplements through factory contamination. The protein powder you purchased at a supplements shop, for example, might contain some ostarine if the manufacturer wasn't meticulous. It is impossible to know which athletes intentionally used ostarine for performance enhancement and which accidentally consumed it through tainted supplements, but antidoping officials believe the latter group is sizable because positive doping tests often revealed only tiny amounts. Another characteristic of ostarine is even more vexing and has caused an erosion of trust in the antidoping system: It is easily transmissible. Maybe too easily for existing antidoping rules. One athlete who tested positive for ostarine was adamant that he had not taken it - but he recalled that he had shared a neoprene hamstring sleeve with someone who had. The athlete's defense was cross-contamination through sweat. \"Is this even a plausible explanation?\" Fedoruk recalled thinking when his research team at the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency was presented with the case. After conducting an elaborate experiment involving the collection of sweat, Fedoruk concluded that yes, ostarine was secreted in perspiration and could be absorbed into a different athlete via a neoprene sleeve. The athlete, a world-class sprinter, was cleared of wrongdoing. Milani had a similar case. But her experience left her wondering if the ostarine situation in sports is even more sinister. Like many American bobsledders, she is a convert from track and field. Too few kids in the United States grow up dreaming of Olympic glory on a bobsled track, so the national team must draw from other sports that feature explosive speed and strength. When her college track career ended at the University of Alabama, she was recruited to join the U.S. bobsled team. The pivot put Milani, who grew up on a farm in central Iowa, onto a mountainside ice chute - and into the stringent protocols of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and, globally, the World Anti-Doping Agency. As a bobsled athlete with her eyes set on the 2026 Winter Games in Italy, Milani had a view of the less glamorous side of the American Olympic movement. U.S. national team members in many sports struggle to make ends meet financially. Milani said it was not uncommon for some teammates to sleep in their cars outside the training center. On top of the financial stress is an antidoping program that bedevils athletes, even the clean ones who want a level playing field. Two aspects of the system, in particular, are chronic sources of complaints: whereabouts and thresholds. Whereabouts rules, designed to prevent cheaters from eluding drug testers, require an athlete to constantly update a schedule, three months in advance, that shares daily overnight locations, a daily 60-minute time slot with a guaranteed location, and training, competition and other activity plans, including for school and work. Three whereabouts missteps trigger a doping sanction. If you relish spontaneity, don't become an Olympic athlete. \"It's what drives a lot of athletes to retire,\" Milani said about the whereabouts demands. The thresholds issue raises grave ethical questions. For athletes under the World Anti-Doping Agency code, there is no threshold, or permissible amount allowed in the body, for most banned substances, including ostarine. Zero tolerance. The argument is that even a trace amount could indicate that the athlete used the drug to enhance performance at an earlier time. But what if contamination from something innocent is possible? Say, a hamstring sleeve? Or even sex? The email Milani received from American antidoping officials said she had tested positive for ostarine at a level of 0.02 nanograms per milliliter, or roughly the equivalent of one drop of water in an Olympic-size pool. (The laboratories that conduct sports doping tests are equipped with instruments that can detect substances at the level of a picogram - one-trillionth of a gram.) The antidoping officials explained that if Milani didn't prove her innocence, she faced a four-year ban. Milani adamantly denied using ostarine. Antidoping investigators learned that her boyfriend at the time, with whom she was living, was using ostarine and, unbeknown to Milani, had put it in an energy drink he made for himself but that she happened to share. She may have inadvertently ingested the drug that way. \"The low level of ostarine detected in Milani's urine samples was consistent with this one-time exposure scenario,\" the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement. \"All of us, we're scared,\" Milani said about the national bobsled team. \"It's terrifying that they don't have thresholds for everything.\" The head of the antidoping agency acknowledged that the rule is problematic and some athletes are being unfairly punished. \"The science is really good now, which is why we've been advocating for fairer WADA rules to make sure athletes aren't convicted for innocent and non-performance-enhancing exposure to prohibited substances,\" Travis Tygart, the agency's chief executive officer, said in an email. There is another exposure scenario that more forcefully challenges the zero-tolerance policy. Researchers have determined that ostarine can be transmitted through semen. A few weeks before I spoke with Milani, a Swiss triathlete was exonerated after antidoping officials determined that \"inadvertent contamination through intimate contact with her partner\" had caused her positive test - for ligandrol, a pharmacological sibling of ostarine. Antidoping officials, acknowledging that Milani had not intentionally used ostarine, reduced her penalty to a one-year suspension, beginning in March 2024. She had thought she would be in the mix for a spot on the team that will compete at this month's Olympics, but missing such a critical period of training was a heavy blow to those hopes. She now has her sights set on the next Winter Olympics, in 2030. But she is disillusioned with the antidoping system. She wonders what the real source was of the trace amount of ostarine in her body. \"I still think I got popped because of sex,\" Milani told me. \"When you think about that, as a woman, it's clearly unfair.\" Several years after their breakthrough in 2000, Dalton joined his former collaborator Mitchell Steiner at a drug development company in Memphis. They licensed the new drug from the University of Tennessee, continued to tweak the formula and began clinical trials in hopes of eventually gaining F.D.A. approval. They never got it. Ostarine still hasn't been approved for use in humans, though Steiner continues to develop the drug, under the name enobosarm. His new company, Veru, has combined it with Wegovy to offset the muscle-wasting side effects common for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. A late-stage clinical study has so far demonstrated that the drug is an effective treatment to maintain lean body mass in obese patients at a 3 milligram daily dose. Steiner hopes to submit an application for F.D.A. approval in 2029 or 2030. Milani spent her year away from the national bobsled team back at the University of Alabama, training with her college strength coaches and building a nonprofit to raise money for U.S. athletes in need. Steps away in the provost's office at Alabama at the time: Dalton, the developer of the drug that caused her banishment. He had pivoted his career into administration. Dalton is no longer actively involved in ostarine's development. Resigned to the reality that the drug is everywhere in sports, he now works to combat its use by athletes. He has advised the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency on ostarine cases and is chair of a scientific advisory board for a group that reviews and funds grants for antidoping research. \"I spend more time now trying to stop people from using it than trying to get people to use it,\" Dalton said. \"That wasn't what I ever set out to do with this.\" He's not part of the antidoping apparatus that will operate 24 hours a day during the Olympics this month in Italy. But he'll be watching from home. His favorite sport at the Winter Games? \"Well, I've always loved bobsled,\" he said. Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

      "title": "Epstein Victims Ask Judge to Shut D.O.J. Website After Names Disclosed",
      "content": "A Manhattan federal judge said he would hold a hearing on Wednesday to consider shutting the government website that houses millions of files in the Jeffrey Epstein case after victims' names were improperly disclosed. The failure to redact the information had turned the lives of nearly 100 individual survivors \"upside down,\" lawyers for a group of victims said in a letter on Sunday. The lawyers' request came as Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged on Monday in a letter to the court that the department had worked through the weekend and had \"taken down several thousands of documents and media that may have inadvertently included victim-identifying information.\" She blamed \"various factors, including technical or human error.\" Ms. Bondi, along with her deputy, Todd Blanche, and Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, wrote that the documents in question would be further redacted and promptly reposted - \"ideally within 24 to 36 hours.\" The clash between the victims' lawyers and the department follows the release on Friday of three million Epstein-related documents, images, videos and other records that were ordered to be made public, with victim information redacted, under a law enacted in November. Ms. Bondi said in her letter that the department had teams of personnel committed to monitoring requests by victims and their lawyers to add redactions to the posted materials. In their letter asking for the Justice Department website to be taken down temporarily, until proper redactions can be made, the lawyers also asked for the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee the process. They described the situation as \"an unfolding emergency that requires immediate judicial intervention.\" \"For the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, every hour matters,\" the lawyers, Brittany Henderson and Brad Edwards, wrote. \"The harm is ongoing and irreversible.\" The letter was addressed to Judges Richard M. Berman, who has overseen the case of Mr. Epstein, who hanged himself in his jail cell while awaiting trial in August 2019; and Paul A. Engelmayer, who supervises the case of Mr. Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, who was tried, convicted and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Judge Berman, who in a brief order on Monday ordered the hearing, said he recognized the \"concern and the urgency\" of the matter and invited the lawyers to bring their clients with them. \"I am not certain how helpful I can be,\" Judge Berman added, saying he encouraged the lawyers and Mr. Clayton to work \"to resolve open issues in good faith.\" Ms. Henderson and Mr. Edwards, in their letter to the judges, said there was \"no conceivable degree of institutional incompetence sufficient to explain the scale, consistency and persistence of the failures that occurred - particularly where the sole task,\" they added, \"was simple: redact known victim names before publication.\" They included comments from several of the firm's clients. One woman, identified only as Jane Doe 2, said all her emails were posted without redactions, and \"quite a few articles have already been published about me.\" Another woman, Jane Doe 5, wrote that she was being harassed by the media and others. \"Please, I'm begging you to delete my name!!!\" A third woman, Jane Doe 8, said her private banking information had been made public and she was trying to shut down her cards and accounts.",

      "title": "Woodie King Jr., Impresario of Black Theater, Dies at 88",
      "content": "Woodie King Jr., a talent-spotting impresario and proponent of Black drama whose New Federal Theater in New York lent a stage to a profusion of future stars, including Denzel Washington, Phylicia Rashad and Chadwick Boseman, and who put Ntozake Shange's acclaimed play \"For Colored Girls\" on the map, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 88. His death, at Weill Cornell Medical Center, was from complications of heart surgery, his wife, the director and actor Elizabeth Van Dyke, said. New Federal Theater, which Mr. King founded in 1970 during the heyday of the Black Arts Movement, was tucked away on Manhattan's Lower East Side, at the Henry Street Settlement. But Mr. King quickly made it a cultural hot spot, with plays by writers like Amiri Baraka , Ed Bullins and Charles Fuller , and a roll call of actors who later found fame, including Debbie Allen, Laurence Fishburne, Morgan Freeman, Jackée Harry, S. Epatha Merkerson, Garrett Morris and Leslie Uggams. A scene from Amiri Baraka's final play, \"The Most Dangerous Man in America,\" about the Black writer W.E.B. Du Bois.

Gerry Goodstein Inspired by the Works Progress Administration's artist-centered, drama-for-the-masses Federal Theater Project of the 1930s, Mr. King knew whom he wanted to champion with his company, and whose work he wanted to channel toward the mainstream. \"People of color and women was what we were after,\" he said in an interview with The New York Times in 2021. In 1976, the year that Mr. King plucked Ms. Shange 's play \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf\" out of a nearby bar and put it on his stage - from which it would travel to the Public Theater, to Broadway, into the canon and onto movie screens - Mel Gussow of The Times wrote that Mr. King had made his company \"a prime generator of new Black plays.\" And, he added, an exciting one: \"I have never been bored at Henry Street, and, almost always, I have been stimulated.\" Ntozake Shange, right, with Janet League in 1977 in Ms. Shange's play \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.\" Mr. King championed the play. Credit... Bettmann Archive/Getty Images In 1981, Mr. Washington and Ms. Rashad shared a New Federal double bill of the playwright Laurence Holder's one-acts. More than a decade before Mr. Washington played the title role in the Spike Lee biopic \"Malcolm X,\" he played Malcolm X (in a \"firm, likable performance,\" Frank Rich wrote in The Times) in \"When the Chickens Came Home to Roost.\" Ms Rashad (\"a fiery young actress,\" Mr. Rich reported) played Zora Neale Hurston in \"Zora.\" The Broadway actor and director LaTanya Richardson Jackson and her husband, Samuel L. Jackson, also acted there early on, in an era when stage jobs were scarce for Black artists outside the Negro Ensemble Company and the New Federal Theater. \"It was a refuge and our bridge over troubled waters of not being able to necessarily be in mainstream theater,\" Ms. Jackson said by phone from Kenya, where she was on safari. Mr. King, she noted, \"created mainstream theater himself, which gave the opportunity for a lot of actors to work. And we will forever be grateful for him for that.\" The paychecks, less so. As Mr. Gussow's article detailed, actors in 1976 were paid $65 a week, and only for performances, not rehearsals. (A mitigating factor: For several years, before funding tightened, tickets to New Federal Theater shows were free of charge.)

Richard Termine for The New York Times \"Woodie was a good guy; everybody liked him,\" Ms. Jackson said. \"You weren't gonna make any money, but at least you got to work. He showed you the benefit of the art, of doing it. You did it so that you could learn and study and be a part of the greater good of creativity - of just being able to help playwrights see their work by getting good actors to do it, and really art for art's sake. He was that guy.\" The New Federal Theater wasn't a place only for emerging artists. Even in its first years, it attracted established stars, too, like Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee , a married couple who acted together in \"Take It From the Top,\" a play that she wrote and he directed. Ms. Allen, the actress and dancer who is Ms. Rashad's sister, performed and choreographed work at the New Federal Theater in the 1970s. She described the company as \"an oasis\" for Black artists, and Mr. King as \"a force of nature.\" \"He pushed and plowed and pushed and plowed to give more space for the African American voice in the theater and film community,\" Ms. Allen said by phone, adding: \"And Woodie nurtured all of us. He gave us opportunities. He would just say, 'Come on, you need to do this. Let's go.' And there you were.\" Mr. King in the 1970s. \"He pushed and plowed and pushed and plowed to give more space for the African American voice in the theater and film community,\" the actress and dancer Debbie Allen said. Credit... Anthony Barboza/Getty Images Woodie King Jr. was born on July 27, 1937, in Bladon Springs, in southwest Alabama, the only child of Woodie Sr., a truck driver who hauled groceries, and Ruby (Jones) King, a domestic worker. During World War II, she moved to Mobile, Ala., to work in a shipyard, leaving young Woodie in the care of relatives. After his parents split up, he and his mother moved to Detroit to join her family there. As he recounted in Juney Smith's documentary film, \" King of Stage: The Woodie King Jr. Story \" (2018), he was 11 when they arrived but was enrolled in the first grade, \"because schools in the South were supposed to be so bad.\" It took him several years, with the help of supportive Black teachers, to catch up to his peers. Drawn to movies, libraries and art museums as a child, Woodie was never a theater kid. After graduation, he got a job as an arc welder at Ford Motor Company and later worked as a draftsman for the city of Detroit. His sense of professional possibility shifted when he saw two Black actors in starring roles in movies: Sidney Poitier in \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958) and Sammy Davis Jr. in \"Porgy and Bess\" (1959). When the Broadway touring production of Lorraine Hansberry's \"A Raisin in the Sun\" stopped in Detroit in the fall of 1960, Mr. King went to the Cass Theater night after night and waited around after the show to talk to the cast. Mr. King was the subject of a 2018 documentary film by Juney Smith. Credit... Rainbow Media Group, Inc Wanting to be an actor, he won a scholarship to the Will-O-Way Apprentice Theater in suburban Bloomfield Hills, Mich., where he was one of just a few Black participants in an overwhelmingly white program. \"But the one thing you couldn't do, you couldn't act in no plays with no white girls,\" he recalled in the documentary. \"In Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, you couldn't even come on the stage with white girls. That's how racist it was in that time.\" So he remained in the program, but pivoted, deciding to learn stage management and other skills to make himself indispensable. By the time he moved to New York City in the mid-1960s, he had already co-founded his first Black theater company, the Concept East Theater, in Detroit. Decades later, in 1996, he earned a bachelor's degree from Lehman College, in the Bronx, followed in 1999 by an M.F.A. in directing from Brooklyn College. In between, in 1997, he won an Obie Award for sustained achievement. Evan Yionoulis, now dean of the drama division at the Juilliard School, was one of Mr. King's graduate school instructors. She remembers \"how open he was both to learning new things and also to sharing things that he already knew,\" she said in an interview. \"He was a real legend by then,\" she added. \"I have to say, I was a little in awe of him.\" Issa Rae, the co-creator and star of the HBO comedy \"Insecure,\" worked as an office assistant at the New Federal Theater from 2007 to 2009, helping with fund-raising when she was just out of college. In an interview, she said Mr. King was \"funny as hell\" and had maintained \"a high bar for Black talent and taste.\" \"It was an education for me,\" she said. \"To see him at the center of it, and to also see that he was in touch with so many people who would still send in donations and who had credited him so much with their start, it was just really cool to witness.\" The first time she ever heard Mr. Boseman 's name was when she held that job, she said. Long before Mr. Boseman played James Brown and the Black Panther in movies, he performed in the New Federal Theater's 2002 production of Ron Milner's play \"Urban Transition: Loose Blossoms,\" which Mr. King directed.

Richard Termine for The New York Times The Tony Award-winning director Kenny Leon said that he and Mr. King, whom he last spoke with just weeks ago, were connected from the beginning of Mr. Leon's career. \"Everything I have in theater, I have to trace it back to him,\" Mr. Leon said. \"When I was even trying to run a theater, and there was no Black Americans running theaters in the country, except Lloyd Richards at Yale Repertory and Woodie King at New Federal, I'd sought them out and sat down with them, and Woodie embraced me and gave me guidance.\" As a member of the administration committee for the 2020 Tony Awards, Mr. Leon successfully argued for giving the New Federal Theater a Tony Honor for Excellence in Theater.

Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Tony Awards Productions Mr. King stepped down as the New Federals's producing director in 2021 but remained on its board. Since 2020, Ms. Van Dyke has been artistic director of the company, whose full name will remain Woodie King Jr.'s New Federal Theater. The last play Mr. King directed, Ms. Van Dyke said, was the 2023 world premiere of Wesley Brown's \"Telling Tales Out of School,\" about women from the Harlem Renaissance. \"He had a major stroke, and he came out on a walker and directed a four-character play,\" said Ms. Van Dyke, who was in the cast. Mr. King's first marriage, to Willie Mae Washington, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Van Dyke, his survivors include three children from his first marriage, Michael and Woodie Geoffrey King and Michelle King-Huger; and five grandchildren. He leaves behind, too, a theatrical landscape reshaped to make more space for Black art and Black artists. \"There was no place for us,\" Ms. Van Dyke said. \"He made a place for us.\"",

      "title": "How Trump Appears in the Epstein Files",
      "content": "The Justice Department looked into sexual misconduct allegations against President Trump in connection with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein but did not find credible information to merit further investigation, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said on Sunday. Mr. Blanche's comments, which he made on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" came less than 48 hours after the Trump administration released about three million pages of documents collected by the Justice Department as part of its yearslong investigation into Mr. Epstein, who died in 2019. The controversy over Mr. Epstein has dogged Mr. Trump for the past year. After Mr. Trump's allies vowed on the 2024 campaign trail to release the Epstein files, his administration rapidly backtracked. Mr. Trump's resistance to releasing the government's files fueled speculation that they contained damaging information about him or his allies. The files are peppered with references to Mr. Trump, who had been a close friend of Mr. Epstein's until the early 2000s. While Mr. Trump has repeatedly downplayed the relationship, the two men bonded over their pursuit of young women. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in connection to Mr. Epstein. Using a proprietary search tool, The New York Times identified more than 5,300 files containing more than 38,000 references to Mr. Trump, his wife, his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, and other related words and phrases in the latest batch of emails, government files, videos and other records released by the Justice Department. Previous installments of the Epstein files, which the department released late last year, included another 130 files with Trump-related references. Many of the documents released on Friday that mention Mr. Trump are news articles and other publicly available materials that had landed in Mr. Epstein's email inbox. None of those files include any direct communication between Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. (Few of the files date back as far as the early 2000s, when the two men were friends.) Here is what our review of the files has found so far. Mr. Trump is named in unverified tips received by the F.B.I. Mr. Trump is one of half a dozen prominent men about whom the agency's files includes \"salacious information,\" according to an email an F.B.I. official wrote to a colleague last year. Some of that information appears to be in the form of more than a dozen tips submitted through the F.B.I.'s National Threat Operations Center in West Virginia. Some of the tips include accusations of sexual abuse by Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein. F.B.I. officials last summer compiled the tips into a summary, which was among the files released on Friday. The F.B.I. summary does not include corroborating information, and The Times is not describing the details of the unverified claims. The names of some of the tipsters in the document have not been redacted. The newly released files also include notes and transcripts of interviews that federal investigators conducted with Mr. Epstein's victims, some of whom describe interactions with Mr. Trump. For instance, handwritten notes from one interview in September 2019 - about a month after Mr. Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail - say that a victim, whose name has been redacted, recalled being transported in a dark green car to Mar-a-Lago to meet Mr. Trump. \"This is a good one, huh?\" the victim recalls Mr. Epstein saying to Mr. Trump. The notes do not suggest misconduct by Mr. Trump. In another file, Juan Alessi, who worked for Mr. Epstein, is reported to have told investigators that Mr. Trump - along with other well-known individuals - had visited Mr. Epstein's home. A White House spokesman declined to comment on questions about specific documents and referred to Mr. Trump's comments to reporters on Saturday, when he claimed that the files \"absolved me\" of wrongdoing. Some of the documents confirm previous reports about Mr. Epstein and Mr. Trump. Investigators, lawyers, journalists and others have spent years trying to understand the extent of Mr. Epstein's relationship with powerful men, including Mr. Trump, and a huge volume of information is already in the public domain. Many of the Trump-related files that The Times reviewed buttress or recycle those materials. Got a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists. See how to send a secure message at nytimes.com/tips Some of the new files are duplicates of emails and other records that the Justice Department or the House Oversight Committee released late last year. Those files show that, long after Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein's relationship ended, Mr. Epstein remained intensely focused on his former friend, which included looking for ways to leverage Mr. Trump's political rise for his own purposes. Some newly released files add to the sense that Mr. Epstein was keeping close tabs on the president. In 2018, for example, Mr. Epstein's accountant emailed him a link to a Reuters article about congressional investigations into Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank, which for years was the president's primary lender . At the time of the email, Deutsche Bank was also Mr. Epstein's main bank. The documents also include files that confirmed previous news articles about Mr. Epstein's relationship with the future president. For example, last August, The Times published an article showing the inside of Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, including how he displayed photos with powerful men like Mr. Trump. Similar photos are included in the files released by the Justice Department. There are also scattered references to the compendium of letters that was presented to Mr. Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003. In one newly released email , from late 2002, an unidentified sender provides an update on the plans for the birthday book, apparently noting that submissions from Mr. Trump and others have not yet arrived. The birthday book, which was released by a congressional committee last summer, ultimately included a bawdy entry apparently signed by Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has denied writing it and has sued The Wall Street Journal for linking him to it.

House Oversight Democrats The files include emails from a woman named Melania. In 2002, a woman named Melania wrote a warm email to Ghislaine Maxwell, Mr. Epstein's longtime associate who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of participating in his sex-trafficking operation. It is not clear if the sender of the email is the future first lady, Melania Knavs, who married Mr. Trump about three years later. The email was sent shortly after New York magazine published a profile of Mr. Epstein that included a photo of him with Ms. Maxwell. The article included a now-famous quote from Mr. Trump in which he called Mr. Epstein a \"terrific guy\" and said that \"he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\" \"Dear G!,\" the October 2002 email begins. \"Nice story about JE in NY mag. You look great on the picture. I know you are very busy flying all over the world. … Have a great time!\" The sender signs off: \"Love, Melania.\" The sender's email address is redacted. Ms. Maxwell does not appear to have replied for a few months. \"Sweat pea - thanks for your message,\" she wrote in January 2003. Ms. Maxwell notes that she is on her way back to New York and will not have time to see Melania. \"I will try and call though,\" she writes. \"Keep well.\" There are also occasional cryptic references to Trump family members in the files released on Friday. A handwritten page from a mid-2000s notebook, for example, describes gifts - including, apparently, a bracelet for Ivana Trump , who was married to Mr. Trump until the early 1990s and who died in 2022. The notes appear to have been written by government investigators. There are a variety of other references to Trump. The files occasionally demonstrate the Trump administration's apparent sensitivity about the president's inclusion in the trove of documents. One file shows a series of text messages between Mr. Epstein and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former adviser, from 2019. One of them includes a photo of Mr. Trump delivering a speech. Mr. Trump's face has been covered with a black redaction box . (Mr. Bannon declined to comment on the messages.) In December, the Justice Department posted and then removed from its website a photo of Mr. Epstein's New York mansion , in which an of Mr. Trump with a number of women was visible inside a drawer. The department later reposted the photo and said it had been temporarily taken down to protect Mr. Epstein's victims. Another email released on Friday indicates that Mr. Epstein was considering whether to contact Mr. Trump in 2011. In an email to a private investigator, Mr. Epstein indicates that he wants to speak to Mr. Trump about Virginia Giuffre. Ms. Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, was one of Mr. Epstein's most prominent victims. She said that she had been lured into Mr. Epstein's web when she worked at Mar-a-Lago. In the email, Mr. Epstein asks the private investigator whether there are any alternatives before contacting Mr. Trump. It is not clear if he tried to reach the future president. Mr. Trump said last summer that he ended his relationship with Mr. Epstein at least in part because Mr. Epstein \"stole\" Ms. Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. Mr. Trump noted that Ms. Giuffre never accused him of misconduct. Reporting was contributed by Dylan Freedman , Nicholas Confessore , Debra Kamin and Zach Seward .",

      "title": "Deep Inside an Antarctic Glacier, a Mission Collapses at Its Final Step",
      "content": "A daring attempt to study Antarctica's fast-melting Thwaites Glacier collapsed over the weekend after the scientists' instruments became entombed within the half-mile-thick ice. A team of British and South Korean researchers was trying to install instruments beneath the immense glacier, where they would collect data, the first of its kind, on the warm ocean waters that are melting away the ice at a rate of hundreds of feet per year. Scientists fear that if Thwaites sheds too much ice, it could cause more of the vast West Antarctic ice sheet to start sliding rapidly into the sea, swamping coastal communities worldwide with as much as 15 feet of extra water over the coming centuries. The team of 10 scientists, engineers and guides camped for more than a week on Thwaites to set up their complex operation. They used a jet of water heated to 80 degrees Celsius, or 176 degrees Fahrenheit, to melt a hole through the glacier, one foot in diameter and roughly 3,300 feet deep. They then lowered instruments to gather data in the water beneath the ice. The clock was ticking: The tiny hole would refreeze in about 48 hours unless the team kept shooting hot water into it. And bad weather was on the way. If the scientists didn't finish by Monday, the helicopters on their research vessel, the Araon, might not be able to fly the team members and their many tons of gear off the glacier before the ship leaves Antarctica around Feb. 7. The final stretch Early Saturday, the scientists collected preliminary measurements with a small suite of instruments that they sent through the borehole and pulled out again. They then lowered nearly 3,900 feet of cable bearing another set of instruments that would remain in place for one to two years. But those instruments only made it about three-quarters of the way through the ice, never reaching the water under the glacier. A project almost a decade in the making had crumbled at the final stage. \"Absolutely gutting\" is how Keith Makinson, an oceanographer and drilling engineer at the British Antarctic Survey, described it. \"You get your window of opportunity. You don't have forever. And you see what you can do.\" Paul Anker, an engineer on the team, checked on the supply of hot water for the drilling operation. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The mooring operation, from above. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times In the end, it was not impenetrable Antarctic sea ice, abysmal weather or finicky equipment that denied these scientists their triumph. It was some combination of these factors and more, working together to rob the team of that most precious resource for any endeavor in the unforgiving polar wilderness: time. There just wasn't enough time to try again. Still, the researchers are not leaving Thwaites empty-handed. The preliminary data they collected on Saturday is the first ever gathered from beneath the glacier's fast-moving main trunk. The data shows that the waters underneath are turbulent and warm, and indicates that there is much to be understood before scientists can predict with confidence how soon Thwaites might go to pieces. \"This is not the end,\" said Won Sang Lee, the expedition's chief scientist. The new data confirms that \"this is the place to go, whatever challenges there are,\" he said. Those challenges started coming well before the team unreeled the doomed cable on Saturday. Whipping winds last week delayed the start of hot-water drilling by a day. After work began, the researchers discovered they had bored through gaping crevasses . On Friday, the depth gauge on their drilling system started giving faulty readings. And, that night, after tunneling through the bottom of the glacier, the hot-water drilling hose got stuck in the borehole as the team was pulling it out. \"It's been a fight every step of the way, this one,\" Peter Davis, an oceanographer, said as his colleagues tried to wrest the hose free. They finally succeeded at around 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. Monitoring progress. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The hose might have gotten trapped because the ice around it shifted, Dr. Davis said. Thwaites's main trunk is sliding toward the sea at a rate of more than 30 feet a day, causing the glacier to stretch and crack. The researchers had been hearing booms beneath their feet all week. At around 1:30 a.m., the scientists sent a camera down the hole. They didn't see major obstructions, so Dr. Davis said they should start sending down scientific instruments right away. They lowered a camera and several oceanographic devices, first through the glacier and then through the roughly 850 feet of ocean underneath. Then they reeled the instruments up through the water again, down and up five times in total. Yixi Zheng, a postdoctoral researcher, watched on her laptop as the data rolled in. \"The temperature is really high in this place,\" Dr. Zheng said, studying the squiggly lines on her screen. In the seas around Thwaites, the scientists had recorded water temperatures of 1.1 to 1.3 degrees Celsius, or 34 to 34.3 degrees Fahrenheit, similar to what they were now seeing under the glacier. \"But still, it's so far away from the open ocean. Having this temperature is crazy.\" \"There's plenty of heat to drive melting,\" Dr. Davis said. Because these first instruments had gone through smoothly, the scientists decided to move ahead with their final task: installing the mooring that they would leave under Thwaites. The data collected by the moored instruments would be transmitted daily, by satellite, to the scientists back at their laboratories. Scott Polfrey, a mechanical engineer, monitored a chain lowering equipment down the borehole. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The team prepared an instrument to be sent through the hole in the glacier. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The heavy, rusty chain, which was intended to hold equipment steady in the water. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The first part of the mooring to go in was a rusty chain, weighing nearly 190 pounds, that would hold everything steady in the water. As the rest of the team helped unspool cable, Dr. Davis and Scott Polfrey, a mechanical engineer, stood above the borehole and attached instruments one by one as the cable went down. \"See you on the flip side, instruments,\" Mr. Polfrey said, as the first pieces of equipment disappeared into the hole. For the next four and a half hours, the team fought through yawns, brain fog and growling stomachs to install the mooring. Shortly after 1 p.m., the cable had at last been reeled out to the desired length, and Dr. Davis knelt in the snow in front of his laptop to communicate with the instruments and see where they were. He typed a bit and peered into the screen. He got up to fiddle with the wiring on the mooring cable. Then he knelt back down at his computer. More typing. More peering. Finally, he lifted his head. \"I think it might be stuck.\" He radioed Mr. Polfrey, who was waiting at the controls about 200 feet away. He asked for the cable to be lowered, to see whether the instruments' depth readings might change. Mr. Polfrey obliged. No luck. Dr. Davis looked stricken. Dr. Zheng held her face in her hands. \"Realistically, whatever's stuck there is frozen,\" Dr. Makinson said. Dr. Davis reacted as the team realized the mooring was stuck. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times At first, Dr. Davis thought a piece of ice might have broken off while the instruments were being lowered, pinning them partway through the hole. Then, he and Mr. Polfrey looked at the data on the amount of weight the cable had been supporting as it was being unspooled. It had fallen abruptly at one point, by 50 kilograms, or 110 pounds. What could have taken off such a big load? After a moment, the answer came to Dr. Makinson. It might have been the rusty chain at the bottom. Somewhere in the hole, the walls may have refrozen enough that the bulky chain didn't fit through, and the rest of the mooring simply piled up on top of it. The researchers tried to break the ice's grip by hauling up the cable. \"I suspect we're not going to get very far,\" Dr. Davis said. \"Let's try,\" Mr. Polfrey said. Time to retreat Dr. Davis trudged off across the snow, not saying anything. After a few paces, he stopped and bent into a crouch, staring off into space. Taff Raymond, one of the team's field guides, knelt beside him and put a hand on his shoulder. Dr. Davis rose and rubbed his eyes. \"Let's get this done,\" Mr. Raymond said. It took just 20 minutes of trying for the team to realize it was hopeless. Mr. Anker tried to find a moment of rest. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Dr. Davis and Yixi Zheng, a postdoctoral researcher, after they learned the mooring could not be installed under the glacier. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Dr. Lee, the chief scientist, conceived of this project nearly a decade ago, in 2017. It took years to pull together funding and gather a team with the British Antarctic Survey. On the group's first attempt to drill through Thwaites, in 2022, the scientists never made it onto the glacier. Thick sea ice stopped the Araon from sailing close enough for the helicopters to fly the gear onto the ice. This time, the team got much further. What motivated Dr. Lee to keep trying? South Korea started its polar science program later than Western countries, he said. Slowly, the nation has built up its research capabilities: It nurtured scientists, built the icebreaker Araon, established two Antarctic bases. All it needed was an achievement to set it apart. \"I wanted to find something unique that we could do and someone else cannot,\" Dr. Lee said. Even if he and his team didn't quite prove that this season, they had learned enough to keep trying, he said. \"If you lose momentum, then it's really hard to go back in the race.\" There wasn't much time to ruminate on Saturday afternoon. The Araon's helicopters had to start slinging cargo back to the ship the next morning. Piece by piece, the drilling camp was taken apart. Cables were coiled, hoses unplugged. The power generators were switched off, and, for the first time in days, the glacier was silent. Mr. Anker, left, and Taff Raymond, one of the team's field guides. Credit... Chang W.

      "title": "As Trump Pressures Holdouts, Spending Deal Gains Momentum in the House",
      "content": "A spending deal to fund most of the government gained momentum in the House on Monday, as President Trump and Republican leaders pressured conservative Republicans to drop their objections to allowing quick action to enact it and end the partial government shutdown. The agreement, which the Senate approved on Friday and was the product of negotiations among Senate Republican and Democratic leaders and the White House, would keep the Department of Homeland Security running for two weeks while Democrats and Mr. Trump negotiate restrictions on the administration's immigration crackdown. But as the bill moved through the Senate, some hard-right lawmakers had raised objections and demanded changes that would have imperiled it, forcing Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson to maneuver to line up the votes to bring it up as planned on Tuesday. By Monday evening, they had persuaded at least two lawmakers who had threatened to derail the spending legislation to back down. Their turnabouts came after Mr. Trump, who endorsed the agreement last week and asked lawmakers to vote for it, reiterated that he wanted to see the legislation passed. \"I hope all Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting this bill, and send it to my desk WITHOUT DELAY,\" he wrote on social media. \"There can be NO CHANGES at this time.\" The House must give final approval to the agreement to reopen major parts of the government - including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation and the Treasury - that were shuttered on Saturday morning. To do so, Mr. Johnson, who can hardly afford any defections given his minuscule majority, must pull together near-unanimous Republican support to get it to the floor. The House took a preliminary step forward on Monday night, when a panel controlled by the speaker advanced the package without making changes. Representatives Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, and Tim Burchett, Republican of Tennessee, had threatened to vote against advancing the package unless Republicans attached unrelated legislation that would require that individuals prove that they are American citizens before they can register to vote in elections. The House passed such a measure, known as the SAVE Act, last year over the opposition of Democrats , who called it unnecessary and argued its requirements would be so burdensome that they could discourage Americans from exercising their right to vote. It has stalled in the Senate, where it would need the backing of at least seven Democrats to reach the 60-vote threshold to proceed to a vote. But after being summoned to a meeting at the White House on Monday, Ms. Luna and Mr. Burchett backed down, telling reporters that they had been given \"assurances\" that the Senate would find a way to take up the bill. Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina, another Republican who had raised objections to the spending deal, said on Monday that he would \"reluctantly\" vote to advance it. Representative Greg Steube, Republican of Florida, said he was opposed overall to the spending package, the product of weeks of bipartisan negotiations , arguing that it contained excessive earmarks requested by lawmakers and funded foreign aid efforts he rejects. \"I will not support that approach,\" he said. \"Our law enforcement and border security professionals deserve clean and responsible funding.\" Representative Greg Steube, Republican of Florida. Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida. Credit... Tierney L. Cross/The New York Times Representative Eric Burlison, Republican of Missouri, told a local radio station that the spending measure, which he opposed as it moved through the House this month, \"did not get better; it got worse.\" \"I don't know why they think that they're going to be able to get all the Republicans to vote for this,\" he said in an interview with KSGF , a Springfield, Mo., station. House Republicans have throughout Mr. Trump's second term insisted they would block legislation, only to buckle when faced with pressure from the White House . They have repeatedly taken the president's word when he has stepped in at critical moments to assure them he will address their priorities , commitments that have not always come to fruition. Mr. Johnson, who has frequently leaned on the president for legislative support , is in a particularly tight spot this week. On Monday evening, he swore in to the House a Democrat who had won a special election in Texas, whittling down the Republican edge in the chamber to the point where he can afford just one defection on any party-line vote if all members are present. It was not yet clear whether he had marshaled the support to bring the measure to a vote. The spending agreement was also dividing House Democrats, many of whom staunchly oppose providing any money for the Department of Homeland Security - even a two-week stopgap measure - given the violent tactics federal agents have used in carrying out Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown. Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, urged his colleagues on Monday to oppose the package, arguing in a letter that Democrats \"must act now to demand real changes\" before giving more funds to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The issue of continuing to provide funding for ICE - particularly after Republicans included $75 billion in funding for the agency in their marquee tax bill over the summer - has emerged as a particularly politically toxic one for Democrats. But driving some of the opposition is also skepticism among Democrats that Republican leaders will agree to any significant changes to the agency. A number of Republicans, for example, have already objected to Democrats' demand that immigration agents not wear masks. \"The reason that ICE agents wear masks is to protect their own identities and protect their own families,\" Mr. Johnson said on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. \"And in some circumstances, they've had a price put on their heads effectively by local officials.\" Some Democrats signaled that they would vote for the package if House Republicans were able to clear the procedural hurdle required to move it to the floor for a vote. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that she would do so. The stopgap measure for homeland security, she said, \"gives us time and it gives us leverage to secure the protections that we need for our communities.\" Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, said \"there's a variety of different perspectives\" on the spending package within his caucus. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said on Monday that \"there's a variety of different perspectives\" within his caucus on the spending package, and that Democrats would continue to discuss it. But Mr. Jeffries said that it was \"hard to imagine\" members of his party helping Mr. Johnson muster the votes to get the spending package to the floor.",

      "title": "A Crisis of Confidence for ICE and Border Patrol as Clashes Escalate",
      "content": "Oscar Hagelsieb spent nearly 25 years as an immigration officer and special agent, proud of his work enforcing federal laws. But watching the chaos unfolding in Minneapolis, and the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen there on Saturday, Mr. Hagelsieb said he felt anger and despair at how the Trump administration was deploying his former agency. \"You're not addressing the problem by throwing a 500-pound gorilla into these inner cities,\" said Mr. Hagelsieb, 52, who said he voted three times for President Trump and retired from the Department of Homeland Security in 2023. \"It's completely unfair to the agents who have been put in this position.\" \"They're causing chaos, and unfortunately it's costing lives,\" he added. \"There's only so much they can handle before bad things start to happen.\" Mr. Hagelsieb's comments reflect a growing sense of fear, frustration and disillusionment among some current and former immigration officials at the department, which is leading Mr. Trump's push to arrest and deport millions of people. In interviews with The New York Times, more than 20 of them expressed anxieties that the administration was sending federal agents into situations in Minneapolis and other major cities that were increasingly dangerous both for them and civilians they encountered. They said that long hours, arrest quotas and public vitriol were taking a significant toll on morale. Some current and former immigration officials expressed anxieties that the Trump administration was sending agents into situations that were increasingly dangerous both for them and civilians. Credit... David Guttenfelder/The New York Times Many also worried that the fallout would irreparably damage how the public perceived the two main homeland security agencies involved in Mr. Trump's crackdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Border Patrol, hurting long-term recruitment and retention. Several said they worried that Democrats would draw on voter outrage to shut down ICE, which has been the most publicly visible arm of the immigration operation, if they returned to power. Some also criticized the more aggressive tactics being used by the Border Patrol, as well as the combative approach of one of its leaders, Gregory Bovino . Mr. Bovino has often used the phrase \" turn and burn \" to describe Border Patrol operations, a reference to actions like smashing windshields, using explosives to blow down the doors of homes and engaging in car chases. Gil Kerlikowske, who during the Obama administration led Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol, said most Border Patrol agents did not have experience \"policing an urban environment.\" Mr. Kerlikowske also said many of the tactics he had seen being used in Minneapolis and other cities, like shooting people with pepper ball rounds and spraying chemical agents at nonviolent protesters, were \"far outside standard practices in law enforcement.\" And he said his conversations with current Border Patrol employees reflected a grim situation. Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of President Trump's Border Patrol operations, has often used the phrase \"turn and burn\" to describe Border Patrol operations, Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times \"Morale is in the dumpster,\" he said. \"Many of the agents will be very happy to go back to the job they were trained for on the border.\" It is hard to know how widespread any sense of discontent is among ICE and Border Patrol agents on the ground in Minneapolis or other cities. Many have been seen arguing with protesters and appear to be supporting one another during confrontations. Paul Perez, the chief of the Border Patrol union, told The Times that morale remained \"high\" and that there were plenty of volunteers for Mr. Trump's immigration operations. \"Agents are concerned about being doxxed, having their families and themselves put at risk,\" Mr. Perez said. \"But I don't think anybody's afraid to do the mission.\" Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, blamed Democrats for the violence and chaos in Minnesota. \"Nobody, including President Trump, wants to see people get shot or hurt,\" Ms. Leavitt said in a statement. \"That's exactly why Governor Walz and Mayor Frey need to allow local police to work with federal law enforcement to remove illegal alien criminals, murderers and pedophiles from Minnesota,\" she added, referring to Tim Walz of Minnesota and Jacob Frey of Minneapolis. Mr. Trump on Sunday posted on social media asking Democratic leaders to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration\" rather than \"resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\" Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement on Monday that ICE and Border Patrol agents were \"fathers and mothers, sons and daughters\" who were trying to \"make our communities safer.\" Over the past year, the Trump administration has rapidly grown both ICE and the Border Patrol, thanks to an infusion of billions of dollars from Congress that has financed an intense recruitment drive. Many homeland security hiring ads feature military-style imagery, like officers wearing tactical gear and driving combat vehicles. They refer to immigration as an \"invasion\" and immigrants as \"enemies.\" Demonstrators marching against ICE in Minneapolis on Sunday. Public opinion has shifted decisively against the agency. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times The Times spoke with current and former officials in the hours after federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday shot and killed Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse who was filming them, the second fatal shooting of a civilian there this month. Many described the deaths of Mr. Pretti and the other American citizen, Renee Good, as points of no return in the relationship between homeland security and members of the public. Most of those who spoke to The Times did so on the condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from the Trump administration if they spoke openly. All of the current and former ICE officials who spoke with The Times said they supported enforcing the nation's immigration laws. Many said they believed that President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s border policies had contributed to the current crisis. They also criticized many blue cities and states for not cooperating more with federal immigration authorities, for instance by restricting their ability to make arrests of undocumented immigrants at jails and prisons , moves that they said were safer than picking people up on the street. But most said they were unhappy with the sharp language from top White House and Homeland Security officials, especially their quick rush to conclude that agents were blameless and Mr. Pretti was at fault, before a full investigation had taken place. One current Homeland Security agent said he had \"always given the benefit of the doubt to the government in these situations\" but he no longer believed \"any of the statements they put out anymore.\" Many also said that Mr. Trump's mass-arrest campaign was proving counterproductive. In part, they said, that was because many federal agents were not thoroughly trained in dealing with hostile crowds, a growing concern as organized groups of protesters have sought to monitor homeland security activities, filming them on the street, following their agents' cars and blowing whistles to disrupt their operations. \"We lost all trust,\" one current ICE official said. \"I'm not sure I can see how we exist three years from now.\" Most ICE agents do not receive specialized training in crowd control, according to a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office . Neither do agents at the F.B.I.; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the U.S. Marshals Service, the report found. Thousands of law enforcement officers from those agencies have also been assigned to the immigration crackdown. Border Patrol agents do receive more extensive training in crowd control. Federal tactics for making immigration arrests have also changed substantially, current and former officials said. In previous administrations, ICE tried to take a more targeted approach. That could involve carrying out several days of surveillance before approaching a suspect, trying to identify the safest place to make an arrest. But the administration's demand for as many as 3,000 arrests per day has significantly reduced the time available for that kind of careful preparation. In a social media post on Sunday, Tim Quinn, a former senior official at C.B.P. who left the agency last year, criticized the White House's \"reckless push for deportation numbers,\" saying that it was \"putting the public and law enforcement at great risk.\" Meanwhile, agents have been told to cast a far wider net, questioning people they encounter about their immigration status, which has made many of their operations resemble indiscriminate street sweeps. That has led to concerns about racial profiling , inciting anger in many communities. \"I'm Hispanic, I look Hispanic,\" Mr. Hagelsieb said. \"I would be highly upset if someone came and asked me if I was illegal because I'm Hispanic.\" Deborah Fleischaker, who was the assistant director for policy for ICE during the Biden administration, said the agency had previously conducted immigration enforcement in a \"careful, thoughtful, targeted way.\" For example, she said, agents would plan extensively to minimize the risk to themselves, their targets and the community. \"None of that appears to be happening anymore,\" Ms. Fleischaker said. Referring to the current operation in Minneapolis and other cities, she added, \"This isn't what they were trained to do.\" John Mitnick, who served as the top attorney at the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration, wrote on social media that he was \"enraged and embarrassed by DHS's lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty.\" Under Mr. Trump, the Border Patrol has also played a sweeping role in enforcing immigration laws within the nation's interior. There are fewer constitutional protections at the border than there are inside the country. It is hard to know how widespread any sense of discontent is among ICE and Border Patrol agents on the ground in Minneapolis or other cities. Credit... Jamie Kelter Davis for The New York Times The agency has sent hundreds of agents to Minneapolis; Chicago; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Portland, Ore.; and Memphis, the main targets of Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown. Several current and former homeland security officials said they believed that the Border Patrol was not prepared to operate this extensively within cities. Border Patrol's more aggressive tactics have led to behind-the-scenes conflicts with ICE, according to current and former federal officials. Two former ICE officials said the public was blaming ICE for Border Patrol's behavior. As Mr. Trump has sent thousands of federal agents into Minneapolis, making it the nation's largest-ever immigration enforcement operation, public opinion has shifted decisively against ICE. Just 36 percent of voters said they approved of the way ICE was handling its job, while 63 percent disapproved, according to a Times/Siena University poll. Fueled by the outrage, Senate Democrats have signaled that they may be willing to partly shut down the government over the Homeland Security Department's funding. One former ICE official questioned whether many Americans would want to work in federal law enforcement after seeing the clashes in Minneapolis. For Mr. Hagelsieb, one particular worry is the number of ICE special agents taken off of complex criminal investigations to instead track down undocumented immigrants, many of whom have not been convicted of crimes. A Times investigation last year found that agents at Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of ICE and is where Mr. Hagelsieb worked, had been reassigned from cases involving sex crimes against children, drug smuggling and terrorism. \"It's like a local police department pulling a homicide investigator to conduct an operation against jaywalkers,\" Mr. Hagelsieb said.

Known as \"Project Vault,\" the effort will entail procuring and storing minerals for American manufacturers. In remarks at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump likened the endeavor to the government's oil reserves and other emergency caches. The reserve will be financed by $1.67 billion in private funds and a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. The bank's board of directors approved the loan on Monday. Speaking in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump framed the announcement as the latest move by the United States to develop its own supply chain for critical minerals, after China curbed exports of its magnets last year, creating shortages for cars, robots, semiconductors, drones and other products. Details about the structure of the loan, which was reported earlier by Bloomberg News , were not immediately available. On Monday, Mr. Trump said that he expects \"the American taxpayer to make a profit from the interest on the loan\" used to support the new reserve. General Motors, Stellantis, Boeing and Google are among the companies that are participating in the project, according to a White House official, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the project. \"Over the past year my administration has taken extraordinary steps to make sure the United States has all of the critical minerals and rare earths that we need,\" the president said. The project will establish the U.S. Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve. The Export-Import Bank said in a statement that it will be a public-private partnership that will store essential raw materials in facilities across the U.S. Mr. Trump has made the global hunt for critical minerals a priority, striking deals with Ukraine and Australia to access their resources and pursuing Greenland, which is rich with natural resources, as the United States looks to secure its stockpiles. The deals include joint projects that would give the United States access to foreign minerals supplies. The United States has also been taking stakes in American rare earths companies as a way to compete more effectively with China. China mines 70 percent of the world's rare earths , and does chemical processing for 90 percent of the global supply. When the Trump administration recently imposed high tariffs and more expansive technology controls, the Chinese government responded by rolling out a licensing system that would give it control over rare earths shipments even outside China. The Trump administration has announced a variety of investments in private companies making minerals and magnets. Last week it extended up to $277 million in direct funding and up to $1.3 billion in loans to USA Rare Earth Inc., a mining and manufacturing group, to help develop its supply chain for rare earth metals and magnets. Last July, the Defense Department agreed to take a $400 million stake in MP Materials, a mining company that has struggled to turn profits amid tough price pressure from China. The new project is intended to shield companies from price volatility of critical materials by allowing them to make purchase commitments and have access to stockpiles without having to store them independently. Republicans have long been skeptical of the Export-Import Bank, but Mr. Trump has embraced it as a way to expand his industrial policy efforts and to compete with countries that rely on government subsidies. \"Project Vault is designed to support domestic manufacturers from supply shocks, support U.S. production and processing of critical raw materials, and strength America's critical minerals sector,\" John Jovanovic, Ex-Im's chairman, said in a statement.",

      "title": "British and Norwegian Royal Families Under Pressure Over Epstein Files",
      "content": "The royal families of Norway and Britain faced mounting criticism on Monday after newly released files tied to Jeffrey Epstein suggested that members of both families, including Norway's future queen, had close relationships with him even after he became a convicted sex offender. The files suggest that Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway and Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor , kept up friendships with Mr. Epstein years after he registered as a sex offender and was sentenced to jail, at a time when some of his crimes were widely reported . He was found guilty of soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008. Ties between Mr. Epstein and the two women had already been publicly reported, and the emails do not show any evidence of criminal activity on their part. But the emails offered new details and in some cases showed that the relationships were deeper than previously known. The files are partially redacted copies of emails between Mr. Epstein and accounts that appear to belong to Ms. Ferguson and to the Norwegian crown princess. The emails were published by the Department of Justice last week as part of a wider release of three million documents. The emails, which include details about visiting Mr. Epstein's residence and jokes about his pursuit of women, appear to show that the Norwegian crown princess was closer to him than the palace had previously acknowledged. The emails were sent between 2011 and 2013 from an account labeled H.K.H. Kronprinsessen, which means \"Her Royal Highness the Crown Princess\" in Norwegian, and sometimes refer to Mr. Epstein with terms of endearment. Crown Princess Mette-Marit said in a statement on Monday that she took \"responsibility for not having investigated Epstein's background more thoroughly\" and that she regretted \"having had any contact with Epstein.\" She said Mr. Epstein's victims had her \"deep sympathy and solidarity.\" A spokeswoman for the Norwegian royal family declined to comment further. The release of the emails, which came just days before the crown princess's son is set to stand trial in a rape case , have thrown the Norwegian royal family into further turmoil. \"I understand why many people have reacted strongly to the revelations in the documents,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway said in a statement on Sunday. \"I have too.\" \"Crown Princess Mette-Marit has herself acknowledged that she has exercised poor judgment, and I agree with her,\" he added. Kjetil B. Alstadheim, the political editor at Aftenposten, one of Norway's largest newspapers, asked in an essay on Sunday: \"Can Mette-Marit become queen after this?\" The new batch of files has also convulsed Britain and its royal family . The documents include what appear to be compromising photos of Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor , formerly known as Prince Andrew, and emails hinting at Mr. Epstein's cozy friendship with Ms. Ferguson, once Duchess of York. Mr. Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his title last year because of previous revelations about his ties to Mr. Epstein. Amid the scandal, Ms. Ferguson also stopped using her courtesy title, the Duchess of York, which she continued to use for decades after their 1996 divorce. Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, in London last year. Credit... Pool photo by Jordan Pettitt The emails are from an account labeled only \"Sarah,\" and some personal information is redacted in the release. But key details, including references to \"the Duchess,\" suggest they are from Ms. Ferguson. A 2010 email, apparently from Ms. Ferguson, refers to Mr. Epstein as \" a legend ,\" adding, \"I am at your service. Just marry me.\" Another email from 2009 refers to Mr. Epstein as the \"brother I always wished for.\" Another from the same year points to him paying for flights for \"the Duchess and the girls,\" apparently referencing travel for Ms. Ferguson and her daughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. Other emails appear to show Ms. Ferguson telling Mr. Epstein she urgently needs money for rent after a failed business venture. In 2011, Ms. Ferguson had admitted that Mr. Epstein helped pay off her debts and apologized for her \"terrible error of judgment\" in \"having anything to do with Jeffrey Epstein.\" Representatives for the British royal family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Ms. Ferguson were not immediately available for comment. In Norway, too, Crown Princess Mette-Marit's relationship with Mr. Epstein was already known. In 2019, the palace told Norway's main financial newspaper that she was not aware of the scope of the crimes he had been convicted of, or their nature, when she was in contact with him. The newly released files suggest that they were closer than previously reported. The emails that appear to be from the crown princess, some of which are signed \"Mm\" and \" Mette m ,\" include discussions of shopping trips, book recommendations, vacations, illnesses and social obligations. In emails from 2013, Mr. Epstein's team made plans for a \"Mette\" to visit \" the PB house \" - he had a house in Palm Beach, Fla. - and to send his driver to retrieve her from a Miami airport. The emails also repeatedly express warmth toward Mr. Epstein. \"You r such a sweetheart,\" said one email sent from H.K.H. Kronprinsessen. \"Are you coming over to see me soon???\" said another . \"I miss my crazy friend.\" The emails also feature repeated jokes about Mr. Epstein's pursuit of women. \"I am on my wife hunt,\" he wrote in 2012. \"paris is proving interesting but i prefer scandinavians.\" \"Paris good for adultery,\" an email sent from H.K.H. Kronprinsessen replied , adding, \"Scandis better wife material.\" One email from 2011 suggests that the crown princess became aware of wrongdoing on Mr. Epstein's part, although it is unclear what it is referring to. \"Googled u after last email,\" the email reads. \"Agree didn't look too good : )\" The latest revelations have threatened to again jeopardize Crown Princess Mette-Marit's public standing. Her engagement to Crown Prince Haakon shocked Norway, but days before the wedding in 2001, she sought to soothe fears by publicly apologizing for her \"wild life\" and condemning drug use. She has since won over some Norwegians, but her ties to Mr. Epstein have put her under new scrutiny. \"It is not just the Crown Princess who has shown exceptionally poor judgment, but an entire state apparatus that has played bankrupt with Norway's international reputation,\" Ole-Jorgen Schulsrud-Hansen, a royal commentator for Norway's TV2, wrote in an essay last week. The Norwegian princess's son, Marius Borg Hoiby, who has no title or official royal duties, is set to stand trial on Tuesday. He has been charged with multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. A lawyer for Mr. Borg Hoiby has said that he \"doesn't acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases - especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence.\" Mr. Borg Hoiby was 4 years old when his mother married Crown Prince Haakon, now his stepfather, in 2001.

      "title": "Mamdani Joined Nurses on the Picket Lines. That's Unusual for Mayors.",
      "content": "In 1909, Mayor George B. McClellan met with garment factory workers who had walked off their jobs sewing ready-to-wear blouses with high collars and buttons down the front. In 1934, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia helped to negotiate the end of a taxi strike after saying that he sympathized with the drivers but would \"tolerate no disorder.\" In 1946, when tugboat workers went on strike, Mayor William O'Dwyer met with labor leaders after condemning maritime crews for refusing to deliver fuel and other essential supplies to city docks. More recently, though, mayors have largely avoided becoming publicly engaged in labor disputes that did not directly involve the city - until now. Mayor Zohran Mamdani has twice appeared with nurses on strike at some of the city's top hospitals . And while some mayors might have tried to assume the role of an impartial mediator, Mr. Mamdani has backed the nurses even as he called on \"every side to come back to that negotiating table\" and settle quickly. \"There's no question it's unusual,\" said Joshua Freeman, a labor historian. \"A high-profile, very public statement by the mayor in support of striking workers - that is unusual.\" During the last major nurses' strike in 2023 , Gov. Kathy Hochul called for binding arbitration, but Mayor Eric Adams did not. He focused mainly on the city's readiness to cope with the consequences for patients who needed medical care. A decade earlier, Bill de Blasio was arrested on a picket line while he was the city's public advocate - four months before he was elected mayor. \"God knows, Ed Koch took sides all the time,\" said Ester Fuchs , referring to Mayor Edward I. Koch. She is a professor of international and public affairs and political science at Columbia University, and she also served as an adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Two years into Mr. Koch's first term, in 1980, there was a citywide transit strike . \"He didn't side with the union,\" said Basil Smikle , a former executive director of the New York State Democratic Party who is now a professor at Columbia. \"He sided with the average New Yorker affected by the union's action, in a way saying: 'Look what the union is doing to us. I'm siding with the people.'\" Mr. Koch made his opposition personal, famously joining commuters on the first morning of the strike and asking, \" How'm I doing? \" as they walked across the Brooklyn Bridge. For Mr. Mamdani, Ms. Fuchs said, \"taking the side of the nurses in this strike is good politics.\" \"It may not have been a statesmanlike thing to do for a mayor who could have come in to negotiate a settlement, but what kind of experience does he have negotiating settlements?\" she said. \"That's not his strong suit. He played his strong suit on the picket line, supporting workers.\" Ms. Hochul's office said that the governor has had daily discussions with the nurses' union and the hospitals. The union, the New York State Nurses Association, said it had received a message from Ms. Hochul and Mr. Mamdani early in the week asking union leaders to resume negotiations. The hospitals - including NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, Montefiore and three Mount Sinai hospitals - did not comment on whether they had gotten similar communication. But the two sides began bargaining again on Thursday, this time in separate rooms in the same building on the same day, not in separate sessions on different days. Mr. Mamdani's office did not respond to a request for comment. In heavily Democratic New York, mayors in the last 90 years have often had ties to labor. Mr. La Guardia ran for re-election as the candidate of the American Labor Party in 1937 and 1941. Mayor Robert F. Wagner, who took office in 1954, was the son of the U.S. Senator who had sponsored the National Labor Relations Act in the 1930s. But in the final weeks of 1965, as Mr. Wagner's time in City Hall was winding down and a contract deadline was looming, he did not take part in negotiations with the transit workers' union. His successor, John V. Lindsay, did not meet with the two sides until after Christmas. He and Mr. Wagner persuaded Theodore W. Kheel , the labor mediator who was once described as the \"master locksmith of deadlock bargaining,\" to lead a three-person mediation panel. But the union went on strike on Mr. Lindsay's first day in office, Jan. 1, 1966. It was the first of several crippling walkouts during his first term. After a teachers' strike in 1968, The New York Times Magazine published an article with the headline \" Why New York Is 'Strike City .'\" It said that \"Lindsay's golden-boy has been a strike victim\" after \"almost continuous conflict on the municipal labor front.\" But Mr. Freeman, the historian, said that by the time Mr. Lindsay ran for re-election in 1969, he \"had come to peace with the unions.\" \"Maybe 'surrender' is too strong a word,\" Mr. Freeman said, \"but that's kind of what happened.\" Times have changed, he said, citing a transit strike that shut down the subways and buses when Mr. Bloomberg was mayor. \"Bloomberg was strongly denunciatory of the strikers,\" he said, \"and weighed in very much on the side of the employer,\" the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency. \"What Mamdani's relationship with the hospitals will be going forward is hard to know,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding, \"We as a city and he as a mayor need well-functioning hospitals, but the hospitals need things from the city.\"",

      "title": "Protesters Rally Across the U.S. in Solidarity With Minneapolis",
      "content": "Crowds rallied in dozens of cities across the nation on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, hoping to build on momentum from demonstrations on Friday against federal operations targeting Minneapolis and other liberal-leaning cities. In Minneapolis - where federal agents have clashed repeatedly with demonstrators in recent months - a rally was punctured with moments of tension, as sheriffs' deputies made several arrests that some protesters deemed to be violent, knocking over some people as they chased others. Hundreds of people rallied in the afternoon outside Los Angeles City Hall, where Isaac G. Bryan, a Democratic state legislator, spoke to the crowd, encouraging them to keep up their protests and pointing to Minneapolis as a model. Noting the Trump administration's decision to move Gregory Bovino , a Border Patrol commander widely criticized for aggressive tactics, from Minnesota, Assemblyman Bryan said it had happened \"because the people of Minneapolis had had enough.\" An afternoon rally in Portland, Ore., swelled to become one of the largest protests the city had seen in months, joined by demonstrators from other events held earlier in the day. Thousands of people crowded into Elizabeth Caruthers Park, near the ICE facility in Portland, for a rally that was supported by several major labor unions. \"This gathering, the size and energy, is unique,\" said Jackson Casimiro, 28, a filmmaker who lives in Portland. Derek Boyd, 46, a dental assistant, came to the protest equipped with a leaf blower to try repel tear gas. \"We have to let them know we won't tolerate this,\" he said of the aggressive way in which federal agents have confronted detainees and demonstrators. Several dozen counterprotesters also appeared, marching past the park chanting, \"God bless ICE.\" People at the rally tried to drown out the chants by blowing whistles and shouting insults. The large crowd marched from the park to Bancroft Street outside the ICE facility, which the local police had blocked off to exclude vehicles. Tensions mounted around 4:30 p.m. when federal agents fired volleys of tear gas canisters into the crowd, which included numerous families with children and others unused to Portland's sometimes fractious street protests. The crowd soon dwindled to a few hundred people. In Minneapolis, about 100 people gathered in frigid weather on Saturday morning outside the B.H. Whipple Federal Building , where federal agents have been detaining suspected undocumented immigrants who have been arrested in the Twin Cities area. Protesters blew whistles and blared air horns. Protest activity intensified across the nation in January in support of the residents of Minneapolis, who have faced an aggressive immigration enforcement campaign by the Trump administration. President Trump announced on Saturday in a social media post that ICE and Border Patrol agents would begin guarding federal buildings, which have become targets for protesters. The killings of two people in Minneapolis - Renee Good and Alex Pretti , both American citizens - by federal agents taking part in the immigration crackdown ignited a powder keg in public opinion over the past week. Hoping to tamp down public anger, President Trump sent his border czar, Tom Homan , to Minneapolis to oversee the immigration enforcement operation there in place of Mr. Bovino. Church bells pealed solemnly throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., on Saturday, expressing solidarity with protesters and with people facing deportation. Meghan Gage-Finn, a senior associate pastor at Westminster Presbyterian in Minneapolis, said that while the bells were a familiar sound to her, their music on Saturday meant something different. Protesters outside Los Angeles City Hall on Saturday held signs denouncing ICE. Credit... Apu Gomes/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images \"I hear them all day long, they ring throughout the day, throughout the week,\" she said. \"But to hear them ringing out in solidarity and in response to what this community is experiencing, I heard them in a new way.\" Some protesters have criticized the prosecution of demonstrators who were accused of interrupting a church service in St. Paul, where a pastor is an ICE official. Two journalists who were present at the incident, including the former CNN reporter Don Lemon , also have been charged. Opponents of the administration's immigration agenda rallied on Saturday in towns and cities, including some that have themselves been targets of aggressive enforcement operations. About a dozen people conducted a sit-down protest against ICE at a Trump building in New York. Nearly 100 protesters rallied in Fair Lawn, N.J., a community outside New York City that is home to many immigrants. One of them was Alex Babin who came to the United States more than two decades ago from Ukraine. On Saturday, he thought of his homeland as he joined the protest. \"Russia attacked Ukraine trying to take their human rights,\" he said. \"Trump supports Russia. And now, here in America, innocent people have been killed because of his policies.\" He added, \"This demonstration is about following the Constitution of the United States.\" Alba Lucia Morales Jimenez, a professor at Columbia University who immigrated to the United States from Colombia, also joined the protest in Fair Lawn. Though she is a naturalized American citizen, she has lately become worried that her citizenship may still not be enough to protect her from being a target for federal agents. \"I don't feel safe any more,\" Ms. Morales said. \"We don't want to be kidnapped, snatched, threatened, pushed, shoved and shot.\" Mourners gathered Saturday by an impromptu memorial at the site in Minneapolis where Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents. Credit... Victor J. Blue for The New York Times Jessica Ochs, a photographer, attended the rally with her husband and 16-year-old son. She said she was frustrated over the killings in Minnesota and the deployment of federal agents across the nation, some of whom have knocked on the doors of her friends. It was important, she said, for people to keep documenting enforcement activity that they see and to hold federal agents accountable. \"We are all witnesses,\" she said. \"We all have phones in our pockets. We should use them for something good.\" Claire Fahy contributed reporting from Minneapolis; Mark Bonamo from Fair Lawn, N.J.; Aaron West from Portland, Ore.; Traci Angel from Kansas City; and Nate Schweber from New York.",

      "title": "Immigration Officers in Minneapolis Will Wear Body Cameras, Noem Says",
      "content": "All immigration officers on the ground in Minneapolis will be equipped with body cameras, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said on Monday. Ms. Noem said that the change would be effective immediately and that the program would be expanded nationwide \"as funding is available.\" \"We will rapidly acquire and deploy body cameras to DHS law enforcement across the country,\" she said in a social media post . The announcement came in response to concern and outrage among many Americans, including lawmakers in Congress, over aggressive tactics that federal officers have used to advance President Trump's immigration crackdown. It follows stumbles in federal officials' accounts of fatal shootings involving federal agents, which have sometimes conflicted with those of local officials and witness videos. Shortly after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good last month in Minneapolis, federal officials said she tried to run over law enforcement and the officer was acting in self defense. State and local officials quickly disputed that account, and a New York Times analysis of available footage of the encounter found no indication that the officer was run over. Some officers in Minnesota have already been wearing body cameras. After federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen, Department of Homeland Security officials said there was body camera footage from multiple angles , which investigators would review. A preliminary review by Customs and Border Protection's internal watchdog office, based on body camera footage and other agency documentation, found that Mr. Pretti was shot by federal officers after resisting arrest, but did not indicate that he brandished a weapon during the encounter, as Ms. Noem had earlier claimed. Department of Homeland Security officials said shortly after the shooting that Mr. Pretti \"wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\" A New York Times analysis of witness videos of the shooting found that Mr. Pretti, who had a firearms permit, had appeared disarmed before he was killed. Federal officials have not publicly released body camera footage of the shooting. Ms. Noem said the policy change on Monday came after she spoke with Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's border czar; the Immigration and Customs Enforcement director; and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner. On Monday, Mr. Trump said it \"wasn't my decision\" but added that body cameras \"generally tend to be good for law enforcement because people can't lie about what's happening.\" Lawmakers from both parties are open to providing additional funds for body cameras. The House last month passed a spending bill that would provide $20 million for purchasing body cameras for federal immigration officers after Democrats pressed for restrictions on ICE. But lawmakers have yet to reach an agreement to fund the Department of Homeland Security as Democrats push for a broader overhaul. The department received a large infusion of funding last year after Congress approved roughly $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement. The agency has sent thousands of officers and agents to Minnesota, saying the enforcement operation is necessary to crack down on illegal immigration and promote safety. The Trump administration has similarly deployed immigration officers to Chicago , Maine and New Orleans in recent months. In October, a federal judge in Illinois ordered federal agents already equipped with body cameras to turn them on while conducting immigration arrests and interacting with residents in the Chicago area. Late last year, ICE told a nonprofit watchdog that it had found \"no records\" of body camera footage produced during its operation in Chicago. That claim raised questions as to whether the administration was fully complying with the court order and contradicted the fact that it had previously submitted footage to a judge. In a statement in December, the Department of Homeland Security said \"ICE never violated the court order.\" Michael Gold and Erica L. Green contributed reporting.",

      "content": "Waymo, the self-driving taxi company owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet, said on Monday that it had raised $16 billion to fuel its plans for global expansion. The company's latest funding round values it at about $126 billion, according to the announcement. The round was led by Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global and Sequoia Capital in addition to Alphabet. The infusion of money could put Waymo further ahead in the growing field of robot taxi companies, such as Amazon's Zoox and Elon Musk's fledgling Tesla robot taxi service . Ride-hailing services such as Lyft and Uber have also struck partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies, including Waymo, to offer driverless rides. Waymo said it would use the money to fuel growth plans, which include rolling out its commercial service and road testing with a safety driver in more than 20 cities this year. A spokeswoman for Waymo declined to comment on the news and pointed to the posted announcement . The company's driverless cars - which operate using artificial intelligence software and are outfitted with multiple sensors - have become omnipresent in San Francisco. Rivals such as Zoox and Mr. Musk's robot taxi are starting to expand but have nowhere near the number of passengers of Waymo. Waymo said it \"more than tripled\" its volume of rides last year to 15 million. The company started offering its robot taxi service in Phoenix in 2020 and has expanded to San Francisco, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Miami and Austin, Texas. In recent months, Waymo has been making plans to increase its presence across the United States and internationally in places such as London and Tokyo. It also recently expanded its Bay Area service to include rides on the highway heading as far south as San Jose, about 40 miles away. Last week, the company said it had started offering some rides to San Francisco International Airport, with a larger rollout in the coming months, as the Bay Area prepared to host major events such as the Super Bowl on Sunday and World Cup matches this summer.",
